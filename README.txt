CSC 156 - Machine Learning
Final Project
Parsa Jafaripour and Robbie Bernstein

Instructions:
	The following Python modules need to be installed:
		- numpy
		- pandas
		- Scikit-learn
		- matplotlib
		- seaborn

	Run from the root folder with "python3 main.py"
	All plots are found inside the "plots" folder, separated by binary and multiclass models

	Due to the large size of the binary dataset, the entire run time to tune and produce results for both datasets is ~ 5 minutes.
